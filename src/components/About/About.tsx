        My journey into web development began six years ago, fueled by a
        fascination with how technology shapes our daily interactions. Over the
        years, I&apos;ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and, most
        notably, React. My experience across various industries, from startups
        to established enterprises, has enabled me to adapt and thrive in
        different work environments.As I&apos;ve grown as a developer, I&apos;ve
        worked alongside senior designers and developers who have raised my
        standards for whatâ€™s expected of any web application.
